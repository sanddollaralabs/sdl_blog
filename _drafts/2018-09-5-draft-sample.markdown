Testing out Jekyll's DRAFT content feature.  By creating content in _draft folder, Jekyll automatically treats the content differently. 

By default your draft files will not be seen on the website.

You can see your draft content by loading the server using a flag - draft

'jekyll serve --draft'

Any posts inside the _draft folder will now be visible.

When you are ready to make your drafts live, you simple move them over the the _posts folder.
